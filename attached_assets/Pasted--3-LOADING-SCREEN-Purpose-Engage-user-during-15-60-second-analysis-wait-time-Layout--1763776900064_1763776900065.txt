### 4. RESULTS SCREEN (Score Reveal)

**Purpose**: Celebrate results and encourage sharing

**Animation Sequence** (2-3 seconds total):
1. Screen loads with circular meter in center
2. Meter animates from 0 to final score (e.g., 82)
3. Meter shrinks and moves to top of screen
4. Other content fades in

**Layout** (after animation):

**Top Section**:
- name of the user and attempt number
- Skill badge: "🎯 HANDSTAND ANALYSIS"
- Large circular score display: "82/100"
- Improvement indicator: "📈 +5 points from last attempt"
- Percentile ranking: "📊 Better than 68% of users"

Mid to bottom section

Left Half: "Issues Summary"
- Show total issues by severity with counts:
  * Critical 🔴: 2 issues
  * Medium 🟠: 3 issues
  * Low 🟡: 1 issue

Right Half: "Score Breakdown"
- Three sub-scores with progress bars:
  * Technique: 80%
  * Completeness: 85%
  * Stability: 75%

**Action Buttons** (fixed at bottom):
- "View Full Analysis"
- "Vide breakdown"

**Component Notes**:
